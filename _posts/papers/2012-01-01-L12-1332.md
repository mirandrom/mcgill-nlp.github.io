## Abstract

Word sketches are one-page, automatic, corpus-based summaries of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour. In this paper we present word sketches for Turkish. Until now, word sketches have been generated using a purpose-built finite-state grammars. Here, we use an existing dependency parser. We describe the process of collecting a 42 million word corpus, parsing it, and generating word sketches from it. We evaluate the word sketches in comparison with word sketches from a language independent sketch grammar on an external evaluation task called topic coherence, using Turkish WordNet to derive an evaluation set of coherent topics.
