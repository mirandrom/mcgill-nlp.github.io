# Description

  This course is a seminar-style course that focuses on advances in multilingual representation learning and how to scale language technologies to many languages of the world including high-resource languages (e.g. English and French), mid-resource languages (e.g. Indonesia and Swahili) and low-resource languages (e.g. Wolof and Quechua)  ,  and some multimodal applications to images and speech. In the first four lectures, I will provide an overview of multilingual NLP, text embedding models, cross-lingual transfer learning and open problems in NLP. 

# Prerequisites

  One of the following McGill courses: Natural Language Processing (COMP 550), Natural Language Understanding with Deep Learning (COMP 545), Applied Machine Learning (COMP 551), or a relevant NLP course at other universities. If you are unsure, email me.
