# Description

The field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen multiple paradigm shifts over decades, from symbolic AI to statistical methods to deep learning. We review this shift through the lens of natural language understanding (NLU), a branch of NLP that deals with “meaning”. We start with what is meaning and what does it mean for a machine to understand language? We explore how to represent the meaning of words, phrases, sentences and discourse. We then dive into many useful NLU applications. 

Throughout the course, we take several concepts in NLU such as meaning or applications such as question answering, and study how the paradigm has shifted, what we gained with each paradigm shift, and what we lost? We will critically evaluate existing ideas and try to come up with new ideas that challenge existing limitations. We will particularly work on making deep learning models for language more robust.

# Prerequisites

You are expected to have done one of the following courses at McGill: natural language processing (COMP/LING 550) or computational linguistics (COMP/LING 445) or applied machine learning (COMP 551) or From Language to Data Science (COMP/LING 345). Make sure you are comfortable with advanced Python programming. If you have done similar courses at other universities, feel free to take the course. If you are not sure, email the instructor.
