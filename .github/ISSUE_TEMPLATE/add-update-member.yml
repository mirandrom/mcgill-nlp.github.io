        If you choose to *add* a member's profile, fill out as many fields as possible. If you choose to *update* a member's profile, *only* fill out the required fields and the fields that you want to modify. Leave everything else blank.
        
        When updating a profile, it will match the profile with the same full `name`. If multiple people have the same full name, it will match the first one encountered. In this case, you might want to to either make the change manually or move an older profile to the bottom (both require editing the YAML file).

        This form will automatically generate a PR that will be reviewed by the maintainers.

        Path or URL or image of the avatar of the lab member. If it's a URL, it will be automatically resized and converted to JPG and saved to `/assets/images/bio`.

        Tip: A simple way to upload a picture is through GitHub; an example is in the FAQ. Otherwise, you can use imgur and give the **direct** link (e.g. https://i.imgur.com/{id}.png).
